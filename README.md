# Rotae
An open-source, non-linear task organizer for iOS. Created at BrickHack 2016 by Austin Lubetkin and Kathleen Burkhardt.

##How does it work?
Each large task is a "wheel", and each wheel is broken into 30-minute segments. After you finish a 30-minute segment of a task, you ideally should take a break. This makes you more productive by allowing you to divide a huge task into less daunting segments, and prevents "burnout" from working for too long.

##How do I use it?

At the first screen, you estimate how long your first task is going to take you to complete. When you are about to start working, press "GO" and the timer will start.

After 30 minutes of working, you will receive a push notification saying "Time to take a break!". Open the notification, press "STOP", and take a break. Once you're ready to go back to work, go back into the app and press "GO".

Once elapsed time is up, you will get a notification saying "Do you need more time?". If you tap "YES", the timer will go on for as long as you need.

##Tech Specs
This project was built using Codea, a simplistic yet powerful version of Lua that allows easy deployment to iOS.

##What's with the name?
"Rotae" is Latin for "wheels", the core UI element of our project.
