# Rotae
An open-source, non-linear task organizer for iOS. Created at BrickHack 2016 by Austin Lubetkin and Kathleen Burkhardt.

##How does it work?
Each large task is a "wheel", and each wheel is broken into 30-minute segments. After you finish a 30-minute segment of a task, you ideally should take a break. This makes you more productive by allowing you to divide a huge task into less daunting segments, and prevents "burnout" from working for too long.

##Tech Specs
This project was built using Codea, a simplistic yet powerful version of Lua that allows easy deployment to iOS.
